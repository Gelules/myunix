I sometimes want to train on a new language. This repo offers me the possibility
to recode UNIX tools in different programming languages.

Why UNIX tools?
Because UNIX has a nice philosophy:
    1. Make each program do one thing well.
    2. Make each program use text as data.
    3. Expect to output to every program to become the input to another.
And more elegant rules.
