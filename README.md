# My UNIX tools
I sometimes want to train on a new programming language. This repo offers me the
possibility to recode UNIX tools in different programming languages.

## Why UNIX tools?
Because UNIX has a nice philosophy:
    1. Make each program do one thing well.
    2. Make each program use text as data.
    3. Expect the output to each program to become the input to another.
And more elegant rules you should read.

Each tool should be usable like the original UNIX one. Only the code differs.

## Examples
Here are some tools I could recode to train:
    * The "shell" ones:
        * echo
        * cat
        * mkdir
        * rmdir
        * cp
        * mv
        * rm
        * ls
        * cd
        * pwd
        * touch
        * ... and so on.
    * A shell-like using the previous listed tools as builtin commands.
    * A netcat client and server to train to code with sockets.

## Methodology
I use the *Test-Driven Development* process in this repo. My goal is also to
improve my skills in *Software craftsmanship*, *Agile* and *XP*.
