‘true’ does nothing except return an exit status of 0, meaning “success”. It can
be used as a place holder in shell scripts where a successful command is needed,
although the shell built-in command ‘:’ (colon) may do the same thing faster. In
most modern shells, ‘true’ is a built-in command, so when you use ‘true’ in a
script, you’re probably using the built-in command.
