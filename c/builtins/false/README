‘false’ does nothing except return an exit status of 1, meaning
“failure”.  It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where an
unsuccessful command is needed.  In most modern shells, ‘false’ is a
built-in command, so when you use ‘false’ in a script, you’re probably
using the built-in command.
